    <string name="game_rules">Game Rules: You will see three figures,
        two at the bottom and one at the top. Two of the figures will have numbers.
        You need to insert the missing number so that the sum of the numbers in the two bottom figures equals the number in the top figure.
        Example: The number in the top circle is 7, one of the bottom figures has a question mark, and the other has the number 4.
        Therefore, the missing number should be 3 because 3 + 4 = 7.</string>
